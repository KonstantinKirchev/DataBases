Entity Integrity Constraint:
The entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a proper value in the primary key field.
This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual rows in a table. If there were null values for primary keys, 
it would mean that we could not indentify those rows.
On the other hand, there can be null values other than primary key fields. Null value means that one doesn't know the value for 
that field. Null value is different from zero value or space.

Referential Integrity Constraint:
The referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between 
the two tables.
The rules are:
1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.

Foreign Key Integrity Constraint:
There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. These constraints 
affect the referential integrity constraint.
	Cascade Update Related Fields:
	Any time you change the primary key of a row in the primary table, the foreign key values are updated in the matching rows in 
	the related table. This constraint overrules rule 2 in the referential integrity constraints.
	Cascade Delete Related Rows:
	Any time you delete a row in the primary table, the matching rows are automatically deleted in the related table. This constraint 
	overrules rule 1 in the referential integrity constraints.
