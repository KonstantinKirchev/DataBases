Problem 4. Difference between a Primary and Foreign Key

Primary key definition: the primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each record in the table. 
It can either be a normal attribute that is guaranteed to be unique (such as Social Security Number) or 
it can be generated by the DBMS (such as a globally unique identifier, or GUID, in Microsoft SQL Server). 
Primary keys may consist of a single attribute or multiple attributes in combination. It can't accept null values.
By default, primary key is clustered index and data in the database table is physically organized in the 
sequence of clustered index. In one table there is only one primary key.

Foreign key definition: a foreign key is a field in a relational table that matches the primary key 
column of another table. The foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables. It can accept multiple null value.
Foreign key do not automatically create an index, but there is a option to manually create an index on foreign key.
Can have more than one foreign key in a table.
