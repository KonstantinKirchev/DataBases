Problem 7. Advantages of Normalized Databases

Some of the benefits of normalization are:
- Data integrity (because there is no redundant data);
- Optimized queries (because normalized tables produce rapid, efficient joins);
- Faster index creation and sorting (because the tables have fewer columns);
- Faster UPDATE performance (because there are fewer indexes per table);
- Improved concurrency resolution (because table locks will affect less data;
- Data consistency within the database;
- A much more flexible database design;
- A better handle on database security.
