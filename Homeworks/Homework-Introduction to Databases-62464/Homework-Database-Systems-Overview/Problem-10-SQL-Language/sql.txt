Problem 10. SQL Language

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a special-purpose declarative language designed for managing data held in a 
relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a RDBMS.
Originally based upon relational algebra, SQL consists of a data definition language (DDL) and a data manipulation 
language (DML). The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema creation and modification, 
and data access control. Although SQL is often described as a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements.
The following is example of SQL query:
SELECT *
 FROM  Book
 WHERE price > 100.00
 ORDER BY title;
