Problem 5. Relationships between Tables in Relational Databases

One-to-one: both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value 
relates to only one record in the related table. Most one-to-one relationships are forced by business rules 
and do not flow naturally from the data. In the absence of such a rule, you can usually combine 
both tables into one table without breaking any normalization rules.

One-to-many: The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the 
related table. This effectively save storage as the related record does not need to be stored multiple times 
in the relating table.

Many-to-many: Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table. 
Many-to-many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational 
systems can not directly accommodate the relationship.

Self referencing relationships: this is used when a table needs to have a relationship with itself. In that kind 
of table there should be one "root" record witch is on the top of hierarchy.
