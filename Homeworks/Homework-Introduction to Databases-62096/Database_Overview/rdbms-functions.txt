RDBMS is a database managment system, is modeled after the Relational model. It stores the data in tables, fields and records. Each table consists of table rows and each row consists of one or more fields. Tables might be related by common fields(columns). Most RDBMSs use SQL as the database query language.
The main functions of a RDBMS is to create/alter/delete tables and relations between them, adding/deleting/changing data rows, creating primary keys, adding indexes for faster data retrieval. Another powerful function is Transaction managment, but it is not supported in all RDBMSs.
