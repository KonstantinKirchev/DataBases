A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows. 
Each table has one or more columns and new data is stored in rows. Some of the columns can allow NULL values. 
There are several differences between relations and tables. One of them is that tables can potentially contain duplicate values, while a relation cannot. Also a table is ordered, while a relation does not have a defined order.
