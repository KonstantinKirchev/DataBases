A primary key is an attribute which uniquely specifies entries in the database table. In order for an attribute to be a good primary key it must not repeat.It is used to order and identify each entry in the table, so same values for the other columns can be allowed without misunderstanding by the database.
A foreign key is a field that matches the primary key in another table. It is needed for the purpose of creating relations between tables. Foreign keys need not have unique values.
Differences between the two types of key are that primary cannot hold null values, while foreign keys can. Also primary keys are indexed, but foreign keys are not. Another difference is that only one primary key is allowed in a table, but it can hold numerous foreign keys.
